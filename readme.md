# Combine Derby

An awful game about smashing things with a combine harvester written in the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/). It can be downloaded from [itch.io](https://richteaman.itch.io/combine-derby).

CI builds can be played at https://richteaman.github.io/combine-derby-godot/ and Windows and Linux builds are also available as action artifacts.

This is a [continuation of a prevous attempt in Bevy](https://github.com/RichTeaMan/combine-derby).

## Building

**This project uses git lfs.** Make sure you have pulled large objects:

```bash
git lfs pull
```

You may need to install git lfs manually for this to work, search for instructions for your operating system.

This project should be opened in Godot 4 (.NET is not required). Download it from [godotengine.org](https://godotengine.org/download/).
