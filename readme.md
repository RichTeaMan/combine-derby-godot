# Combine Derby

An awful game about smashing things with a combine harvester written in the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/). A [continuation of a prevous attempt in Bevy](https://github.com/RichTeaMan/combine-derby).

A web version of it can be found at https://richteaman.github.io/combine-derby-godot/. Windows and Linux builds are also available as an action artifact.
